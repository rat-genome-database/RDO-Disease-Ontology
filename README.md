# RDO-disease-ontology

RGD's Disease Ontology is based on and closely related to the Human Disease Ontology found at http://disease-ontology.org/.  Because some terms needed for curation of rat data do not fit within the scope set by the developers of the human DO, RGD has added a subset of additional terms for use by RGD curators.

To request new terms or changes to existing terms, please click "Issues" --> "New Issue".
-   For new term requests, if possible please include the requested term, a definition and a proposed position in the ontology
 (i.e. one or more parents and, if applicable, any children).
-   For requests for changes to existing terms, please list the DO ID, the term and the issue.  We will not make changes to terms in the originating ontology but will rather send those along to the DO developers.  We can, however make changes to "custom terms" in the ontology (any with a DOID that begins with "DOID:9..." the numerical portion of which has 7 digits).
